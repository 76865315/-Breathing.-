            ## Breathe - Breathing Exercises App

            **15 evidence-based breathing techniques** for stress relief, better sleep, and focus.

            ### Installation Instructions for Mac

            1. Download `Breathe-1.0.0-arm64.dmg` below
            2. Double-click to open the DMG
            3. Drag Breathe to Applications
            4. **First launch:** Right-click (or Control-click) on Breathe and select **"Open"**
            5. Click **"Open"** in the security dialog
            6. The app will now run normally going forward

            > **Why this extra step?** This app isn't signed with an Apple Developer certificate ($99/year). The right-click method tells macOS you trust this app.

            ### If you see "damaged" error
            Open Terminal and run:
            ```
            xattr -cr /Applications/Breathe.app
            ```
            Then open the app normally.
