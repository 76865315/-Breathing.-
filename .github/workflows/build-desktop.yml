            ## Breathe - Breathing Exercises App

            **15 evidence-based breathing techniques** for stress relief, better sleep, and focus.

            ### Installation Instructions for Mac

            1. Download `Breathe-1.0.0-arm64.dmg` below
            2. Double-click to open the DMG
            3. Drag Breathe to Applications
            4. **Important:** Right-click (or Control-click) on Breathe and select "Open"
            5. Click "Open" in the dialog that appears
            6. The app will now open and you can launch it normally from now on

            > **Note:** This app is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate. The first time you open it, macOS will show a security warning. Using "Right-click > Open" bypasses this for apps from identified developers.

            ### Alternative: Terminal Method
            If the above doesn't work, open Terminal and run:
            ```
            xattr -cr /Applications/Breathe.app
            ```
            Then double-click Breathe to open.
