(b) **Arbitrator Selection:** The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules.

(c) **Arbitration Location:** Unless the parties agree otherwise, the arbitration shall take place in [CITY], [STATE].

(d) **Arbitration Hearing:** The arbitrator may conduct the arbitration through written submissions, telephonic hearings, video conference, or in-person hearings, as determined by the arbitrator.

### 17.5 Arbitration Fees

Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.

### 17.6 Opt-Out Right

### 17.7 Exceptions to Arbitration

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may:

(a) Bring an individual action in small claims court if the claim qualifies;

(b) Seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of intellectual property rights;
