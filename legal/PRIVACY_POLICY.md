## 20. DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS

### 20.1 Do Not Track

Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that sends a signal to websites you visit, indicating you do not want to be tracked.

### 20.2 Our Response

Because the Breathe App does not track users across third-party websites or services, we do not currently respond to DNT signals. We treat all users the same regardless of DNT settings.

### 20.3 Global Privacy Control

We honor Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals as requests to opt-out of the "sale" or "sharing" of personal information under applicable state laws. However, since we do not sell or share personal information, this has no practical effect.
